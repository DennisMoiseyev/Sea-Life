                - "It's a three day weekend and you decided to spend the day at the beach. The sand is nice
                  and warm. The water is calm and serene, the waves gently crashing onto the surface. It's a very
                  relaxing day, which calls for a relaxing activity. You wish to:"
                  
                - You take a field trip with your Oceans 80A class to the Natural Bridges tide pools as part of a class assignment. You eventually grow tired of scouting for
                  various anemones and minute ocean critters and decide to sneak away to the beach. The water is very nice on this day and you spot many surfers 
                  out in the water. The sand is nice and soft. The water is slightly choppy, but not quite at high tide. What is the plan?
                  
                - This summer season you decide to take a relaxing vacation to Cancun, Mexico. After you drop off your bags and settle into your hotel room, you 
                  head straight for the beach. The water is calm and serene, the waves gently crashing onto the surface. The warm sun is beaming down your neck and you gently fall
                  into a state of total relaxation, which calls for a relaxing activity. What should you want to do?
                  
                - You are stranded on a deserted island with only a suitcase full of your bare necessities. Although you should be quite alarmed at the situation,
                  you find it quite enjoyable. Being beached on such a magnificent looking beach may not seem as bad you initially believed. You are quick to remove
                  your clothes and slip into your swim wear. The water is welcoming, the waves gently crashing onto the surface. The sand is the whitest you have seen. 
                  Now, you should decide on what you want to do.

                - After struggling to build the sand castle, you decide to give up and go for a dip in the ocean.
                
                - "Building a sand castle is not how you want to spend your day. You decide you'd rather go for a swim."

                After swimming farther than you wanted to, keeping to the right, you spotted a shark in 
                the distance. The shark seems to be circling around a sunken ship wreck. The ship appears
                to be very dated. It could be worth exploring.

                Going in this direction, you swim up close to a green sea turtle. You've always admired them 
                from the other side of glass panels at aquariums, but now you're right next to one in the ocean!
                This is really exciting, so you decide to swim beside it wherever it may lead you.

                Deciding to swim in a straight pathway towards the depths of the ocean, you come across a school
                of dolphins. Dolphins are very friendly and playful sea creatures. They are your favorite animal.
                You've only seen them swimming beside boats on trips you've taken and their performances at SeaWorld. 
                Swimming alongside a school is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

                The turtle has led you to a coral reef filled with many varieties of beautiful tropical 
                fishes. This would look good for your scrapbook. Good thing you equipped that underwater camera
                before going in the water.

                You were able to avoid the shark and swim up to the sunken ship. Guess that shark repellant came in handy. 
                You swim around the ship and stumble upon a treasure chest, hidden beneath the barnacle covered
                helm.

                You successfully secured the treasure and brought it back to the shore. Upon opening it, you
                discover golden chalices and jewels. Sometimes, risks are very rewarding. You carefully carry the
                chest to your car and drive off with the treasure. What an eventful beach day!

                adventure for one beach day. Time to get out of the water and head home.

                Looks like seeing that shark was enough for you to call it a day. You
                swam out of the water as fast as you could and quickly left the beach.
