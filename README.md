# *Sea Adventures*

I love the ocean and all the life it holds within it. Therefore, this project is mainly inspired by my love of the sea. 
One of my favorite hobbies is traveling to Mexico or Hawaii and swimming in the gorgeous oceans they have to offer. 
When I was a child, I frequented aquariums and always loved to go shopping for a new fish at pet stores. Some of my fondest memories
are visits to the beach with my family, so this is why I chose this theme for my light project. I make it a religion to watch *Shark Week* and am always
interested in any film that takes place in the ocean. One time in Maui, I had an encounter with a giant sea turtle. I was swimming right beside it, but, regrettably,
I didn't have a waterproof camera to capture the moment. 

### Procedural Text
**This is a very calm, passive interactive game compared to the other one I did for this assignment. I encourage you to play around with the sand castle scene. 
Because of the procedural text I implemented in my code, the scene offers something different each time you replay the game! Not only that, but every time you
replay the game the opening scene will present you with a different scenario!**
